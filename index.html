                <h3>Introduce myself</h3>
                <p>Greetings! I am Ajis Maulana Shadiq, a computer science student studying at Universitas Islam Nusantara, located in the city of Bandung. Currently, I am in my sixth semester, which began in the academic year 2021, and I aspire to become a Fullstack Developer.</p> <br>
                <p>Bandung is not only where I study but also where I reside with my beloved parents. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for harnessing technology to become a Fullstack Developer. Since my early days in vocational school, particularly in the field of software engineering, I became fascinated with the world of programming and chose to continuously refine my skills.</p> <br>
                <p>I also enjoy playing the guitar, immersing myself in the world of gaming, or actively contributing to outdoor activities. With diverse interests, a thirst for knowledge, and considerable organizational experience, I am ready to make a meaningful impact on the future trajectory of technology as an IT professional.</p>

                <h2>Design Grapich</h2>
                <p>I have graphic design skills because I often self-study through platforms like YouTube, and from there, I am quite proficient in using industry-standard software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Capable of creating visually appealing designs for various purposes, and coincidentally, I have successfully created designs such as logos, posters, and banners for organizational events.</p>

                <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
                <p>In my journey in the IT world, I have honed a strong skill set in website development by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I became interested in learning all of this since I was in school, and my enthusiasm continued to burn brightly as I pursued further education in college to deepen these skills. This web portfolio serves as evidence that I have the skills to create websites.</p>

                <h2>Backend Developer</h2>
                <p>Aside from exploring frontend design, I'm also captivated by the backend world. I frequently use PHP to create efficient programs, and my preferred databases are MySql and PostgreeSql. In fact, on several occasions, I've utilized frameworks like Laravel and CodeIgniter to develop programs. That's why I aspire to become a fullstack developer.</p>

                    In addition to immersing myself in the world of IT through my college studies, I also have a hobby that is common among many people, which is photography. This is because I don't spend all my time playing on the computer. The reason is that I find great joy in capturing aesthetic moments through my camera lens, and it's not uncommon for me to get opportunities to participate in various photography-related activities within certain photographer organizations.</p>

                <p>
                    When feeling drained and hitting a wall while working on a program, I often indulge in a brief gaming session to alleviate the stress of hitting a creative roadblock. Surprisingly, after that, my mind feels rejuvenated, brimming with new energy, and ready to dive back into work with a fresh perspective.</p>

With experience using applications such as Adobe Premiere and Filmora, I am able to add creative touches to every visual project I work on, creating compelling and captivating end results for viewers.</p>
